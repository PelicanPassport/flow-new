Flow Build 24 - No-Input Mode
-----------------------------
- Removed all manual inputs (sliders, context chips, outcome markers).
- The entry screen is now pure free text + Save.
- The app infers mood/energy/focus/contexts from language & metadata.
- Nighttime advice triggers only on high-risk/activated days; Tomorrow preview always shows.
